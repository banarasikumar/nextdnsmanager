## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security seriously, and I appreciate your assistance in responsibly disclosing any vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please follow these guidelines when reporting it:

1. **Privately Disclose:**  
   Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until I have had a chance to address it. Instead, report it privately via email or by opening a confidential issue in the repository.

2. **Provide Sufficient Details:**  
   Include all relevant information needed to understand and reproduce the issue. This should include details such as:
   - The device and Android version you are using.
   - The version of NextDNS Manager.
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.

3. **Responsible Disclosure:**  
   Allow a reasonable period for me to fix the vulnerability before any public disclosure.

Thank you for helping me maintain the security of NextDNS Manager.
